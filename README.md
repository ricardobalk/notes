# Notes

Collection of personal notes, quirky ideas, and random thoughts.

### [code-examples/docker/neo4j](./code-examples/docker/neo4j)
Small Neo4j Graph Database example that automatically imports a basic set of data from a CSV on its first run.


### [code-examples/docker/metabase](./code-examples/docker/metabase)
Demo of Metabase, a business intelligence tool that allows users to visualize and analyze data from various sources. Runs Metabase, Postgres and two demo databases. One of them is using MySQL 8 and the other is using Postgres.


## [code-examples/docker](./code-examples/docker)
This directory contains a few of my example Docker setups for different applications and services. Each of these directories represents a hands-on example of how I work with Docker in different environments. Feel free to explore, use, or improve them!
